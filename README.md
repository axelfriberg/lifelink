# Lifelink, a Magic the gatering life counter

Since I still haven't found my perfect lifecounter for MTG that has all the features I want I decided to build it myself.

Notable features:

- Round timer
- Round tracking (who has won each round within a match).
- Life history that keeps track of life changes for each player.
- Realtime feedback on life changes.
- PWA so it can be installed on your homescreen.
